# MalariaDetection

This is a web application focused on detecting malaria. My teammates and I have worked on various components, which include:

1.Training six deep learning models: CNN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, YOLOv5, Vision Transformer, and EfficientNetB0.
2.Creating a Power BI report.
3.Developing a website by integrating a Vision Transformer (.h5) file and the Power BI report.

Analysis of PowerBI Include making report with the help of estimated, reported and incidence_per_1000 analysis number of cases and deaths over WHO Region, Country and years(2010 - 2017).
